# Hidden Valley Honey Website

I designed and coded this single page website for Hidden Valley Honey, a New Zealand based apiary.
<br>
The draft of the site is hosted on Github Pages and can be viewed [here](https://adamjq.github.io/hidden-valley-honey-website/).

### Notable features:
* 'Sticky' Navigation Bar that displays once the Main Navigation is not visible.
* 'Smooth Scrolling' between anchors when using the Navigation Bars.
* A full width Google Map, made with the [GMaps library](https://hpneo.github.io/gmaps/).
* Use of [Ion Icon fonts](http://ionicons.com/).
* Contact Form using PHP to send an email to the business**.
* Responsive CSS3 using media queries to style for different device widths.


### Technologies used:
* HTML5
* CSS3
* Javascript
* Jquery
* PHP


** The PHP folder contains a working version of the mailer form. As Github Pages cannot host PHP code the contact form is not functional in the draft version of the site.
